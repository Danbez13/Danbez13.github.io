    <h3>What my best friends said about me:</h3>
    <p>Harrison:</p>
    <p>Dan Bezant is a kind and gentle being. A big value of his, is usually to benefit others before himself. For example: He will check up on me during periods of time where we haven't been able to meet up as often. Asking how I have been and how I am doing, offering to get lunch, or just chill out together in order to relieve me of stress. However, Dan will avoid openly sharing his negative feelings. Not to say he is particularly self-destructive, but perhaps as a way to avoid gravitating his burden to others. He tends to rely souly on himself to deal with problems. Dan has fought educational systems for years with his dyslexia. Getting by seemingly okay, but by no means over-achieving to great lengths. For this reason, he developed a value most fail to recognise. A real value of people. There is nothing Dan would rather do,than to hang out with people. To be around them, to hear their stories and make new ones. He understands that time onearth is not an expectation, yet a gift. Too many examples of this exist in the 11 years I have known Dan. During intermediate school, nearly every friday night we spent at his place or mine playing video game. During College, having movie nights and (when we were old enough) driving around doing anything and everything. In our first year of Uni, he would come knocking on my dorm room door at some point during the day to hang out for an hour or so. Also, any social event Dan is invited to, he will attend. I can honestly say that the friendship I have with Dan exists more in the real world, than on a screen.</p>
    <p>Kerri:</p>
    <p>Dan's a quiet person, yet really social and loving of his friends. He seeks to help people, he's a great listener and loves making people smile. Its evident by the folder of dog pictures he has on reserve to send his friends to make them smile when they need it. He values friendships above most things. He also values loyalty and is honest in his promises. He showed me this when he jokingly promised to get me a trophy for my birthday months before my actual birthday. Then when that day came around he handed me the trophy. It's a silly example but he kept that promise and he has kept so many other important ones too. Overall, I believe Dan values his connections with people and he works hard to maintain close friendships</p>
    <p>Aidan:</p>
    <p>I think one of Dans strengths is problem-solving and the ability to think super abstractly inside restrictions to obtain a goal, this is reflected in being great at video games and coding. Likewise I think he has got a vivid imagination which definitely helps and ties into this as well. I think you’re creative and very curious about things in music/art/media/games that are outside the norm, the strange or bizarre instantly catches your attention; this is probably where our love for science-fiction comes from. In social settings to me you come across as sometimes quiet at first (if sober hah) but once you feel more comfortable you’re easy to talk to and always unafraid to point out the hilarity of a situation. I admire that you come across as very genuine and ‘yourself’ in your interactions with people - no matter how well you know them; and that you remain true to your values when around groups of people.</p>
