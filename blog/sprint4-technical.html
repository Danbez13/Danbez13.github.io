    <p>A time I got stuck and how I solved it:</p>
    <p>During this sprint I got stuck on a looping exercise it was a fairly simple problem that I had created myself by adding an unnecessary ‘=’ into my code I spent an hour trying to fix the problem by altering code and searching the internet to no avail which stressed me out. I then got a peer to help me and they spotted my problem and helped me fix it resulting in the whole code working, i learnt that i should ask for help when needed and proofread my code.</p>
    <p>Problem solving techniques:</p>
    <p>I'm fairly confident in using most of the problem solving techniques each of them are very useful to use when working through tasks and each are unique at solving different problems. I especially find using google to be useful as if there's a problem its likely been solved before and posted on the internet, also seeking help from peers and coaches is very useful as you can work through it together and figure out what the problems are.</p>
