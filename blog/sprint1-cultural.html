        <h3>My Values and Character</h3>
        <p>Through what i have gathered i feel my code personal values are loyalty and friendship.</p>
        <p>I think this shows through an ethical decision i had to make was when two of my friends where having an argument and I chose not to pick a side but instead try and help them solve the argument between them from looking at it at another perspective and ended up solving the argument.</p>
        <p>I feel that my culture has been very influential in forming my values though what my parents have taught me and where i grew up.</p>
        <p>My strengths would be my ability to not give up easily and my weaknesses would be my dyslexia which causese me to struggle with maths and writing.</p>
        <p>I think this shows when i was doing the Talent show for Joan Stevens Hall And we only had 3 days to prepare, the band and I only managed to come up with the songs we were going to do the on the 2nd day leaving us 1 day to learn 2 songs, at this point we were given a choice to either give up or keep going we chose to keep going which resulted in an alright performance and a reallt fun night.</p>
        <p>I feel that my strengths will help me see the course through and motovate me to do my work, as for my limitation I will just have to ask for help when i need it.</p>
