    <p>JavaScript and Html:</p>
    <p>The main difference between javascript and html is javascript can be used to make dynamic web pages whereas html makes static, Html is sort of like a book all of its pages stay the same where javascript would be like a movie its pages can move and change.</p>
    <p>Control flow and loops:</p>
    <p>When you tell a computer to loop it is basically telling it to follow a routine for example getting up in the morning, having a shower, going to school or work, coming home and having dinner, then going to bed is all a loop that you might repeat each day. </p>
    <p>The DOM:</p>
    <p>What your internet browser displays is a web document, it is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working together to display the webpage. There is a hierarchical structure that your browser uses to make sense of everything going on, this structure is the Document Object Manual or the DOM for short.</p>
    <p>The DOM is made up from more than just Html elements and these elements are called nodes, nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments, document-related stuff, and many other things.</p>
    <p>The DOM is without a doubt the most important piece of functions as it provides the link between all your Html, CSS, and JavaScript files essentially making it the main building block when creating a website.</p>
    <p>Arrays and Objects:</p>
    <p>Arrays and objects are basically the same thing the main difference between them is that arrays keep something stored using a number and with objects you can use a word/title to store something.</p>
    <p>Functions:</p>
    <p>Functions are basically sub programs of a main program which can be called when needed, they are really useful when wanting to use a piece of code multiple times as it means you don't need to write it out each time, this also makes your code cleaner because there is less repetitive code.</p>
