        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>
        <p>That anything is achievable if you put your mind to it, that it is important to take breaks, and to be aware of mindfulness such as meditation.</p>
        <p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
        <p>How important it all is when it comes to web development and finding a job</p>
        <p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
        <p>Writing about myself has been particularly challenging as i don't want to appear braggy.</p>
        <p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
        <p>Because it is an important aspect of finding a job in web development and it is important to have core skills when learning new things.</p>
        <p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
        <p>I feel that the time i spent core learning was very important in understanding programming as it taught me things like mindfulness which is a very useful skill to have while programming.</p>
