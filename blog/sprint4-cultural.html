        <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity:</p>
        <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because it allows them to know it exists and work harder on maintaining a neural pathway with what they are learning and can give way for them learning anything they want. i've engaged with the principles of neuroplasticity when learning to play guitar or riding a bike through  practicing over and over again until i became competent in these things, practicing is the best way to increase neuroplasticity as the more you practise the stronger the pathway the brain develops making it stick around in your brain for longer.</p>
        <p>Growth Mindset:</p>
        <p>The growth mindset is understanding that you can do something which makes it really important when learning new things when people understand that they can learn something it increases their growth mindset making it easier for them to learn it, I will attempt to integrate it into my learning journey through staying positive and knowing that it is possible to learn new things.</p>
        <p>My learning plan:</p>
        <p>I think i will fit this into my learning plan quite well as i will be spending more time reinforcing my neural pathways with my learning.</p>
